Here are the examples for deep learning applications on drug discovrey realm.
1. Deep_learning_sample1_drug_discovery_oneInput_twoOutputs.ipynb


Hightlight
-utilized RDKit (Open-Source Cheminformatics Software  https://www.rdkit.org/)
-Appying K-fold validation to unbia train process.


How to use?
If you have small molecule drugs with SMILE and other numerical chemical/physical properties.
-One Input: Featurized numerical feature of the small molecule from SMILE by chemcepterize_mol() function.
-Multiple Outputs: e.g., binary class, binding affinity..etc

PS: If you have more than one numerical feature, try Concatenate all numerical features as One Iuput.
